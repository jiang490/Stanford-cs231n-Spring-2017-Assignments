# Stanford-cs231n-Spring-2017-Assignments
Completed assignments for the course. Some highlights: use GA to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the neural network, achieving around 5% improvement over the best model mentioned in the assignment1.

Great thanks to all the contributions to cs231n from Stanford university. It is a great course!
